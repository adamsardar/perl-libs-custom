Installation:
------------

This package uses GNU autoconf generated configure scripts, see the
file INSTALL.configure for generic configure documentation.

Pre-requisites:
--------------

You'll need to install 2 extra libraries that are used by the toolkit:

* The Boost C++ libraries or boost for short (http://www.boost.org)
  which provides free portable libraries compatible with standard
  libraries.
  We currently rely on boost version 1.37.0. 
  This version can be downloaded at:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/ 

* Log for C++ library or Log4cpp for short.
	Log4cpp is a library of C++ classes for flexible logging to files, 
	syslog, IDSA and other destinations.
	See the page of the project on SourceForge:
	http://log4cpp.sourceforge.net/

AltSplicingToolkit:
------------------

Once Boost and Log4cpp are installed, simply type:

./configure --prefix=<altsplicingtoolkit installation path> \
--with-boost-include=<boost installation path>/include/boost-1_37 \
--with-boost-lib=<boost installation path>/lib \
--with-log4cpp=<log4cpp installation path>

make

and (as root)

make install
